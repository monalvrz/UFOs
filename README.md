# UFOs

## Project Overview
For this project we created an HTML page that contains information about UFO sightsings. We used Javascript to display the data as a table and to add dinamic filters that would allow the public to fine tune the information of the sightsigns according to the date, city, state, country and shape of the UFOs.

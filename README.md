# UFOs

## Project Overview
For this project we created an HTML page that contains information about UFO sightings. We used Javascript to display the data as a table and to add dinamic filters that would allow the public to fine tune the information of the sightigns according to the date, city, state, country and shape of the UFOs.

## Results

When you enter the site, you will first find a short text that introduces the theme of UFO sightsigns. The section below contains the table and the filters that can be used to obtain more specific information depending on the date, city, state, country and shape of the sightings. 

In order to perform a search you simply enter one or more filter criteria, and the table will change automatically. If you want to change or remove a filter, simply delete or overwrite the information.

### Applying one search criteria:

### Applying two search criteria:

## Summary

A drawback of the page is the relevance of the country filter. The database has only two non-US results, which could make the search category confusing or irrelevant. For further development the page could include more information with results that vary in the location of the sightings which would make the filter criteria more useful and important. 

It could also be useful to move the location of the interactive section that generates the filters. Instead of being on the side it could be at the top of the table, which would facilitate the search and present the information in a cleaner way. Another element that could help the page to be better developed is to present, at least, the date range of the information presented. The user when entering the page will want to select any filter without really knowing what information the database contains.
